Salt SSH Secure
===============

This is a set of salt states which implement the most secure settings as suggested by https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html.

This has only been tested on Debian linux, I wouldn't be opposed to making it a bit more modular though, and expanding it's usefulness to other distros.
